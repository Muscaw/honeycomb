# HoneyComb

HoneyComb is a cli tool allowing easy management of your tmux environments.

What HoneyComb provides:
- create pre-defined sessions based on projects found in your workspace
- join pre-started session if one already exists in your environment

HoneyComb can be configured through a TOML file in `$HOME/.config/honeycomb/config.toml`.

workspace_markers: ["*/.git"]
# Additional search paths to add to your list of projects. The list is taken as-is and added to the project list.
