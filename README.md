# HoneyComb

HoneyComb is a cli tool allowing easy management of your tmux environments.

What HoneyComb provides the following features:
- create pre-defined sessions based on projects found in your workspace
- join pre-started session if one already exists in your environment

## Installation

`pipx install honeycomb-cli`

## Configuration

HoneyComb can be configured through a TOML file in `$HOME/.config/honeycomb/config.toml`.

If you have `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` set, HoneyComb will look in these locations as described in the [XDG specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/#basics).

_config.toml_
```toml
# Path to your workspace containing all your projects
workspace_path: "~/workspace"
# Pattern to match to find all the projects in the first level of your workspace folder. Must match Python's Path.glob() definition https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob
workspace_markers: ["*/.git"]
# Additional search paths to add to your list of projects. The list is taken as-is and added to the project list.
additional_search_paths: []
```

`comb list-projects`
